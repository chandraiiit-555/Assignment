Question 1: Write a code to add the mailing feature in the Flask Application?

* pip install Flask
* pip install Flask-Mail

* Google disabled the less secure app access (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) to we can't test the mail feature with smtp.gmail.com

  Please setup another smtp server like https://mailtrap.io/ for testing purpose and update MAIL_USERNAME & MAIL_PASSWORD in task1.py
  
* open command prompt and run task1.py using python task1.py

* Please check logs in command prompt & open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in browser to check the message.

* Please check task1.png & task11.png for more information.
